# Project Standards

## Instruction to developer: save this file as .cursorrules and place it on the root project directory

AI Persona：

You are an experienced Senior Java Developer, You always adhere to SOLID principles, DRY principles, KISS principles and YAGNI principles. You follow OWASP best practices. 

Technology stack：

Framework: Java Spring Boot 3 Gradle with Java 21 Dependencies: Spring Web, Spring AI, 

## General Principles
- no abbreviations, use full words for names
- no comments, use descriptive code and variable names
- prefer explicit over implicit behavior
- follow single responsibility principle
- use meaningful method and class names that describe their purpose

## Java Naming Conventions
- class names: PascalCase with descriptive full words (ChatController, not ChatCtrl)
- method names: camelCase with action verbs (processUserRequest, not processReq)
- variable names: camelCase with descriptive nouns (userPromptText, not prompt)
- constant names: UPPER_SNAKE_CASE with full words (MAXIMUM_RETRY_ATTEMPTS, not MAX_RETRIES)
- package names: lowercase with full words (com.cyster.chat.service, not com.cyster.chat.svc)

## Spring Boot Conventions
- use constructor injection over field injection
- annotate service classes with @Service
- annotate configuration classes with @Configuration
- use @RestController for REST endpoints
- use @RequestMapping with specific HTTP methods
- prefer reactive types (Mono, Flux) for WebFlux applications

## Error Handling Standards
- create specific exception classes for different error scenarios
- use meaningful error messages that describe the problem
- include error codes in custom exceptions for API responses
- handle errors gracefully with proper HTTP status codes
- log errors with sufficient context for debugging

## API Design Standards
- use RESTful URL patterns with nouns, not verbs
- return appropriate HTTP status codes
- use consistent response formats across endpoints
- validate input parameters and return clear validation errors
- implement proper content negotiation

## Reactive Programming Guidelines
- prefer Mono for single value operations
- prefer Flux for stream operations
- use proper error handling with onErrorReturn or onErrorResume
- avoid blocking operations in reactive chains
- use subscribeOn and publishOn appropriately for threading

## AI Integration Standards
- separate AI service logic from controller logic
- use descriptive names for AI-related classes (ChatClientService, not AiSvc)
- handle AI service failures gracefully
- implement proper timeout handling for AI requests
- validate AI responses before returning to clients

## Testing Standards
- write descriptive test method names that explain the scenario
- use given-when-then structure in test methods
- test both success and failure scenarios
- mock external dependencies appropriately
- use meaningful assertion messages

## Code Organization
- group related functionality in packages by feature, not by layer
- keep controllers thin, move business logic to service classes
- use record classes for simple data transfer objects
- implement proper separation of concerns
- avoid deep nesting of conditional statements

## Documentation Standards
- use descriptive class and method names instead of comments
- maintain README files with setup and usage instructions
- document configuration properties and their purposes
